# Karatsuba-Algorithm
 The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm that uses a divide and conquer approach to multiply two numbers. The naive algorithm for multiplying two numbers has a running time of O(n^^2) while this algorithm has a running time of O(n^^(1.585) Being able to multiply numbers quickly is very important. Computer scientists often consider multiplication to be a constant time O(1) operation, and this is a reasonable simplification for smaller numbers; but for larger numbers, the actual running times need to be factored in, which is O(n^^2). The point of the Karatsuba algorithm is to break large numbers down into smaller numbers so that any multiplications that occur happen on smaller numbers.
